# Data Projects

Hey, good to see you here! This is my repo with some of my data projects that I've worked. 

[Work in progress]

## [Distance between Cities and Capital](https://github.com/felipemayer/data_portfolio/tree/main/distance_cities_capital).

Given a csv of cities and their capital, determine the distance between them and export a new CSV to product and ops team.

A real project in **Python** with: 
- Data manipulation with **Pandas**
- **Requests** to access url with information (distance)
- **Web Scraping** to get the information (distance).
